**INTRODUCTION**  
This repository is intended to store code for learning fundamental C# concepts and skills. It also serves as a practice
space for version control using Git and GitHub, including changelog management.

**CHANGELOG for git-chglog**

1. If capable, you can update the installation tool npm initially, by running the following command
   `npm install -g npm@x.x.x`, where x.x.x is your target npm version. You can then verify the installed npm version in
   Rider by running `npx npm --version` or `npm -v`.

2. Install `git-changelog` using the following command `npm install -g git-changelog` in your terminal. You can also
   verify the installed git-changelog version in Rider by running `git-changelog --version`.
